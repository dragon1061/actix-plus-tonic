# Actix + Tonic

A sample project that shows how set up an [Actix
Web](https://github.com/actix/actix-web) server that communicates with a
"backend" gRPC server via [Tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic).

## Actix Web

The initial code for the Actix Web part of this project was taken directly from
the [Getting Started](https://actix.rs/docs/getting-started/) documentation
page.
